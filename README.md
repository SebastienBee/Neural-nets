# Neural-nets
Braaaaiiins
...Or, rather, artificial mathematical systems that are capable of modeling problem-solving behavior in a manner that resembles a network of biological neurons. As is right and proper.

# Important notes for python scripts

These scripts and modules were written in Python 3, using Anaconda 3.
Python 2 users can go suck it.
